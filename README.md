- **Driver Dashboard:** Allows drivers to report their locations and receive rewards.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: Smart contract development
- Brownie: Ethereum development framework
- React.js: Frontend development
- Leaflet: Interactive maps
- Ether.js: Ethereum JavaScript library
- React Native: Mobile application development

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm start`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
5. install necessary packages `pip install requirements.txt`
6. initialize brownie

```bash
    cd contracts
    brownie init
